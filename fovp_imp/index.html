            <p class="question-text">1. Define the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET Framework. Explain its role in the execution of .NET applications.</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The <strong>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</strong> is the core component and execution engine of the .NET Framework. It's responsible for managing the execution of .NET applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Roles:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Code Execution:</strong> It converts intermediate code (MSIL/CIL) into native machine code using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Automatically manages memory, most notably through <strong>Garbage Collection (GC)</strong>, which reclaims memory from unreferenced objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Enforces code and access security (e.g., Code Access Security).</li>
                    <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> Manages exceptions (errors) that occur during execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Ensures that code is type-safe and prevents memory corruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thread Management:</strong> Provides services for managing application threads.</li>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-text">2. List and briefly describe core components of the .NET Framework with neat diagram.</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The two main components are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Common Language Runtime (CLR):</strong> The execution engine that handles running applications. It provides services like JIT compilation, memory management (GC), security, and exception handling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Framework Class Library (FCL) / Base Class Library (BCL):</strong> A comprehensive library of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types. It provides common functionalities for tasks like string manipulation (<code>System.String</code>), data access (<code>System.Data</code>), file I/O (<code>System.IO</code>), web development (<code>System.Web</code>), and more.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>These components are supported by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Type System (CTS):</strong> Defines how types are declared, used, and managed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Language Specification (CLS):</strong> A subset of CTS that defines rules for language interoperability.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-text">3. What is the Common Type System (CTS) in .NET? How does it contribute to the language interoperability in .NET?</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The <strong>CTS (Common Type System)</strong> is a standard that describes all data types (e.g., integers, strings, classes, structures) and how they are declared, used, and managed in the CLR.</p>
                <p>It contributes to language interoperability by providing a single, common model for data types. This ensures that objects written in different .NET languages can interact with each other. For example, a C# <code>int</code> and a VB.NET <code>Integer</code> both map to the same CTS type (<code>System.Int32</code>), allowing them to be passed between a C# and VB.NET class seamlessly.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-text">4. Compare and contrast the roles of the Common Language Specification (CLS) and the Common Type System (CTS) in .NET.</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Type System (CTS):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Defines *all* possible data types and rules for the .NET framework. It's the complete set of types.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Comprehensive (e.g., it includes types like <code>System.UInt32</code> - unsigned integer).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Common Language Specification (CLS):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Role:</strong> A *subset* of the CTS. It's a "gentleman's agreement" or set of rules that a language must follow to be considered ".NET compliant" and fully interoperable with other .NET languages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> More restrictive. For example, the CLS does not include unsigned integers, as not all languages (like VB.NET) support them. Code that only uses CLS-compliant features is guaranteed to work with any other CLS-compliant language.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> CTS defines *what* is possible. CLS defines *what* you should use for maximum interoperability.</li>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-text">5. Explain the significance of Garbage Collection in .NET. How does it improve memory management?</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p><strong>Garbage Collection (GC)</strong> is the automatic memory manager in the CLR. Its significance is that it removes the burden of manual memory management from the developer.</p>
                <p><strong>How it improves memory management:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It runs as a background process, checking for objects in the managed heap that are no longer being used (i.e., have no active references).</li>
                    <li>When it finds such objects, it automatically reclaims the memory they were using.</li>
                    <li>This prevents common programming errors like <strong>memory leaks</strong> (where memory is allocated but never freed) and improves application stability.</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The .NET Framework architecture is a layered model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Top Layer (Languages):</strong> Various programming languages like C#, VB.NET, J#, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Layer (Common Language Specification):</strong> Ensures languages can interoperate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Layer (Framework Class Library):</strong> A vast library of code for common tasks, divided into namespaces:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>System.Web</code> (for Web Forms, Web Services)</li>
                            <li><code>System.Windows.Forms</code> (for Windows Forms applications)</li>
                            <li><code>System.Data</code> (for ADO.NET data access)</li>
                            <li><code>System.Xml</code> (for XML processing)</li>
                            <li>And many more base classes (<code>System</code>, <code>System.IO</code>, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom Layer (Common Language Runtime - CLR):</strong> The "engine" that manages code at execution time. It includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Garbage Collection (GC)</li>
                            <li>Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilers</li>
                            <li>Code Manager & Security</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This entire structure sits on top of the Operating System.</p>

                    <li><strong>Managed Code:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Code that is executed *by* the Common Language Runtime (CLR). Examples include C# and VB.NET.</li>
                            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> The source code is first compiled into an intermediate language (MSIL). The CLR then JIT-compiles this MSIL to native machine code at runtime.</li>
                            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> The CLR provides services like automatic garbage collection, type safety, and security. The developer doesn't need to manage memory directly.</li>

                            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> The source code is compiled directly into a native executable (.exe or .dll).</li>
                            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Can offer direct, low-level access to hardware. The developer is responsible for all memory management (allocation and de-allocation), which is more complex and can lead to errors like memory leaks.</li>

                    <li><strong>Traditional (Precompiled Native Code, e.g., C++):</strong>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Can have a very fast startup time since no compilation is needed at runtime.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> The compiled code is not portable; you must create a different executable for each platform (Windows-x86, Windows-x64, Linux, etc.).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The application is distributed as intermediate language (MSIL). When the application is run, the CLR's JIT compiler converts the MSIL into native machine code *on the fly*, method by method, as it's needed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>

                                    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The same MSIL assembly can run on any platform that has a .NET CLR, as the JIT will compile it for the local machine.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> The JIT can potentially optimize code based on the *actual* runtime environment and CPU.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Slight Startup Cost:</strong> There is a small performance hit the first time a method is called because it needs to be JIT-compiled. (This is often negligible).</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p><strong>Significance of MSIL (or CIL):</strong> MSIL is a CPU-independent set of instructions. It is the low-level language that all .NET compilers (C#, VB.NET, etc.) compile their source code *into*.</p>
                <p><strong>Contribution to Platform Independence:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MSIL is not tied to any specific CPU or Operating System.</li>
                    <li>An application compiled into MSIL can be run on *any* platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) that has a compatible .NET runtime (like the CLR or .NET Core).</li>
                    <li>On that platform, the runtime's <strong>JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler</strong> takes the platform-independent MSIL and compiles it into the *native machine code* for that specific environment.</li>
                    <li>This "compile-once, run-anywhere" model is the key to .NET's platform independence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Portability, language interoperability (all languages compile to the same MSIL).</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Requires a runtime to be installed on the target machine. A very slight performance cost on the first run for JIT compilation.</p>

        <h2>Unit 2: Basics of Object-Oriented programming using C#</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-text">1. List and describe the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The practice of bundling data (fields/attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It also involves hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world using access modifiers (like <code>private</code>), only exposing what is necessary through public methods or properties (data hiding).</li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism that allows a new class (the *derived* or *child* class) to acquire the properties and methods of an existing class (the *base* or *parent* class). This promotes code reusability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Literally "many forms." The ability of an object or method to take on different forms. It is achieved in two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Compile-Time (Method Overloading):</strong> Creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type of arguments).</li>
                            <li><strong>Run-Time (Method Overriding):</strong> A derived class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class (using <code>virtual</code> and <code>override</code> keywords).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boxing:</strong> The process of converting a <strong>value type</strong> (like <code>int</code>, <code>struct</code>) into a <strong>reference type</strong> (<code>object</code>). This is an <em>implicit</em> (automatic) conversion. The value is "boxed" by wrapping it in a new object instance on the managed heap.

            <p class="question-text">3. Explain the concept of Checked and Unchecked Blocks in C#. Why are these important for handling overflow?</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p><code>checked</code> and <code>unchecked</code> are keywords that control how C# handles <strong>arithmetic overflow</strong> for integral types (like <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>checked</code> block:</strong> Forces the runtime to check for an overflow. If a calculation exceeds the maximum or minimum value of the data type, an <code>OverflowException</code> is thrown.
                        <br>
                        <code>int i = int.MaxValue;</code><br>
                        <code>checked { int j = i + 1; } // Throws OverflowException</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><code>unchecked</code> block:</strong> (This is the default behavior in C#). It <em>ignores</em> overflow. If a value exceeds the limit, it simply "wraps around" (truncates the result).
                        <br>
                        <code>int i = int.MaxValue;</code><br>
                        <code>unchecked { int j = i + 1; } // j becomes int.MinValue</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong> They are important for numerical safety. You use <code>checked</code> in financial or scientific calculations where an incorrect, wrapped-around value would be disastrous. You use <code>unchecked</code> when you are certain an overflow won't happen or if you specifically *want* the wrap-around behavior (e.g., in some graphics or hashing algorithms).</p>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Type casting (or conversion) is converting a variable from one data type to another.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implicit Casting (Safe):</strong> This is an automatic conversion done by the compiler when there is *no risk of data loss*. This typically happens when converting from a smaller, less precise type to a larger, more precise one.
                        <br>
                        <code>int myInt = 100;</code><br>
                        <code>double myDouble = myInt; // Implicit cast from int to double</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Explicit Casting (Unsafe):</strong> This requires the programmer to manually specify the conversion using parentheses <code>(type)</code>. It is required when there *is* a risk of data loss or the conversion might fail. This happens when converting from a larger type to a smaller one.
                        <br>
                        <code>double myDouble = 100.75;</code><br>
                        <code>int myInt = (int)myDouble; // Explicit cast. 'myInt' is now 100. The .75 is lost.</code>

                <p><strong>Auto-Implemented Properties</strong> are a shortcut for creating properties when no extra logic is needed in the <code>get</code> or <code>set</code> accessors. The compiler creates a private backing field automatically.</p>
                <p>The question asks for *both* auto-properties and get/set *methods*, which is redundant, but here is how you would do each:</p>
                <p><strong>Using Auto-Implemented Properties (Modern C#):</strong></p>
                <code>

    public string Author { get; set; }

}
</pre>
                </code>
                <p><strong>Using Get/Set Methods (Older style, not recommended unless required):</strong></p>
                <code>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>Normal</code>:</strong> The image is placed in the top-left corner. If the image is larger than the <code>PictureBox</code>, it is clipped. (Best for 1:1 display).</li>
                    <li><strong><code>StretchImage</code>:</strong> The image is stretched or shrunk to fit the exact size of the <code>PictureBox</code>. This can distort the image's aspect ratio. (Good for simple borders, bad for photos).</li>
                    <li><strong><code>AutoSize</code>:</strong> The <code>PictureBox</code> control itself resizes to fit the full size of the image.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>CenterImage</code>:</strong> The image is centered within the <code>PictureBox</code>. If the image is larger, it is clipped.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Zoom</code>:</strong> The image is stretched or shrunk to fit the <code>PictureBox</code>, but it *maintains* its original aspect ratio. This is often the best choice for displaying photos, as it ensures the image fits without distortion.</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>In ASP.NET, a page (often) posts back to itself. All server controls are wrapped in a single <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.</p>
                <p>The <strong><code>runat="server"</code></strong> attribute is the most important part. It tells ASP.NET that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The form and its contents should be processed <strong>on the server</strong>.</li>
                    <li>All controls inside it (like <code>&lt;asp:Button&gt;</code>) are <strong>server controls</strong>, not plain HTML.</li>
                    <li>This allows them to have properties, raise server-side events (like <code>OnClick</code>), and maintain their state across postbacks (using ViewState).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When a button is clicked, the form is POSTed back to the server, ASP.NET rebuilds the page, loads the ViewState, and then fires the specific server-side event (e.g., <code>Button1_Click</code>) that caused the submission.</p>

                    <li><strong><code>CompareValidator</code>:</strong> Compares the user's input against a fixed value or the value of another control (e.g., to check if "Password" and "Confirm Password" match).</li>
                    <li><strong><code>RegularExpressionValidator</code>:</strong> Checks that the input matches a specific pattern (a "regex"), such as a pattern for an email address, phone number, or zip code.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>CustomValidator</code>:</strong> Allows you to write your own custom validation logic on the server-side (and optionally on the client-side).</li>

                    <li>It is <strong>read-only</strong> (you cannot update data with it).</li>
                    <li>You use a <code>while (reader.Read())</code> loop to iterate through the records one by one.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is used in a <strong>connected environment</strong> because it *requires* the <code>Connection</code> object to remain open and active for as long as you are reading data from it. As soon as you close the connection, the <code>DataReader</code> becomes unusable.</p>

                <p><strong>How it works (Disconnected):</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A <code>DataAdapter</code> opens a connection to the database.</li>

                    <li>The application is now "disconnected" and can read, add, edit, and delete rows in the local <code>DataSet</code>, all while having no connection to the database.</li>
                    <li>Later, the <code>DataAdapter</code> can reconnect and call its <strong><code>Update()</code></strong> method, which inspects the <code>DataSet</code> for changes (new, modified, or deleted rows) and executes the appropriate INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE commands on the database to synchronize the changes.</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p><strong>WPF</strong> stands for <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong>.</p>
                <p>It is Microsoft's modern UI framework for building rich, graphically-intensive desktop applications for Windows. It is a subsystem of the .NET Framework (3.0 and higher).</p>
                <p><strong>Main Uses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To create visually rich user interfaces that go beyond standard buttons and text boxes.</li>

                    <li>To create applications with complex animations and data binding.</li>
                    <li>It separates the UI *appearance* (defined in <strong>XAML</strong>) from the application *behavior* (defined in <strong>C#</strong>).</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Grid Panel:</strong> Arranges controls in a table-like structure of rows and columns. Most flexible and common.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stack Panel:</strong> Stacks controls in a single line, either vertically (default) or horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dock Panel:</strong> Allows you to "dock" controls to the edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) of the panel. The last element fills the remaining center space.</li>
<li><strong>Wrap Panel:</strong> Arranges controls in a line (horizontally or vertically) and "wraps" to the next line when it runs out of space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Canvas Panel:</strong> A simple layout panel that allows you to position controls using explicit X/Y coordinates (e.g., <code>Canvas.Left="10"</code>). Least flexible, as it doesn't resize.</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p><strong>XAML</strong> stands for <strong>eXtensible Application Markup Language</strong>. It is a declarative, XML-based language used to define the user interface in a WPF application.</p>
                <p><strong>Use / Purpose:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> XAML's main purpose is to separate the *appearance* (the UI design) from the *behavior* (the logic). Designers can work on the XAML file to create the layout, while developers work on the C# "code-behind" file (e.g., <code>MainWindow.xaml.cs</code>) to handle events and logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Declarative UI:</strong> Instead of writing C# code to *create* and *configure* a button (<code>Button b = new Button(); b.Content = "Click";</code>), you simply *declare* it in XAML (<code>&lt;Button Content="Click" /&gt;</code>). This is cleaner and more readable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rich Features:</strong> XAML is used to define everything from simple controls (buttons, textboxes) to complex layouts (Grids, StackPanels), data binding, styles, and animations.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stack Panel:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It arranges its child controls in a single line (a "stack"). You can set its <code>Orientation</code> property to <code>Vertical</code> (default) or <code>Horizontal</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>When to use:</strong> Use it for simple layouts where you just need a list of controls, like a form with labels and textboxes stacked vertically, or a toolbar with buttons stacked horizontally.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Grid Panel:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It arranges controls in a flexible grid of rows and columns. You define <code>RowDefinitions</code> and <code>ColumnDefinitions</code>, and then place controls into specific cells using <code>Grid.Row="0"</code> and <code>Grid.Column="1"</code>. Rows/columns can have fixed, auto, or proportional (*) sizing.</li>

            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The <strong><code>PasswordBox</code></strong> control is a specialized text input control used for entering passwords.</p>
                <p><strong>Difference from <code>TextBox</code>:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Masking:</strong> The <code>PasswordBox</code> automatically masks the characters as the user types (e.g., showing • or *). A <code>TextBox</code> displays plain text by default.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> The <code>PasswordBox</code> does *not* store the password as a plain text <code>string</code> in its <code>Text</code> property (it doesn't have one). Instead, the password must be accessed via its <code>Password</code> property or, more securely, its <code>SecurePassword</code> property. This helps prevent the password from being stored in memory as plain text.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> It lacks features like spell-checking and multi-line support, as they are not relevant for passwords.</li>

            <p class="question-text">7. Describe how animation is implemented in WPF using Storyboards...</p>
            <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Animations in WPF work by changing the value of a property (like <code>Opacity</code>, <code>Width</code>, or a <code>Transform</code>) over a period of time (a <code>Duration</code>).</p>
                <p>A <strong><code>Storyboard</code></strong> is a container that holds and manages one or more animations. It allows you to group multiple animations together and control them as a single unit (e.g., start, stop, pause).</p>
                <p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You create an <strong>Animation</strong> class (e.g., <code>DoubleAnimation</code> to animate a <code>double</code> property like <code>Opacity</code>).</li>
                    <li>You set its <code>From</code> value, <code>To</code> value, and <code>Duration</code>.</li>
                    <li>You set the animation's target by specifying the <code>Storyboard.TargetName</code> (the <code>Name</code> of the control to animate) and <code>Storyboard.TargetProperty</code> (the property to animate, e.g., <code>(Rectangle.Opacity)</code>).</li>
                    <li>You place this animation inside a <code>Storyboard</code>.</li>
                    <li>You typically start the <code>Storyboard</code> using an <strong>Event Trigger</strong> (e.g., when the control loads or a button is clicked).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Key Properties:</strong> <code>From</code>, <code>To</code>, <code>Duration</code>, <code>AutoReverse</code> (to play backwards), <code>RepeatBehavior</code> (to loop).</p>
